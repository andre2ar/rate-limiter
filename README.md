# Rate Limiter

Rate limiter middleware created to run over fiber web server.

## Running the server

The live reloading server can be run by the following commands:

``make up``

or

``docker-compose up``

There is only one end-point:

``localhost:8080/api/v1/session``

This end-point will only create a JWT and return it.
